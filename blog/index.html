          <div class="post-content">
            <p>I have been reminded over the past couple of days just how
              powerful the CSS language is. In very little time I was able to
              organize and style this website to a professional quality. For
              any beginners who strugle with CSS, I would recomend getting a
              solid understanding of the box-model. It can be hard to position
              items right where you want them on the web page, and knowing the
              box-model greatly reduces the difficulty of this.

            Experimenting with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS
          </h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>I've decided to start the venture of learning to code on my own.
              While the bulk of the coding language and content I have learned
              thus far was taught to me by an instructors or professors, and
              since I am no longer in school, it seemed like the
              <em>prefect</em> time to further my knowledge on my own.</p>
            <p>This started over the past week with learning the basics of
              <strong>JavaScript</strong>. In the future I plan on trying to
              develop applicationson the <strong>Ehtereum</strong> blockchain.
              While there are unique languages and frameworks you must know to
              begin coding blockchain, I have heard from the dev community that
              learning <strong>JS</strong> is a good starting point.I have spent
              a lot of time in the past year learning how to use
              <strong>Java</strong>, and this has honestly made learning JS a
              breeze :)</p>
