                		<p>I have been reminded over the past couple of days just how
              				powerful the CSS language is. In very little time I was able to
              				organize and style this website to a professional quality. For
              				any beginners who strugle with CSS, I would recommend getting a
              				solid understanding of the box-model. It can be hard to position
              				items right where you want them on the web page, and knowing the
              				box-model greatly reduces the difficulty of this.</p>

              			<p>I've decided to start the venture of learning to code on my
              				own. While the bulk of the coding language and content I have
              				learned thus far was taught to me by an instructors or professors,
              				and since I am no longer in school, it seemed like the
              				<em>prefect</em> time to further my knowledge on my own.</p>
              				<p>This started over the past week with learning the basics of
              				<strong>JavaScript</strong>. In the future I plan on trying to
              				develop applicationson the <strong>Ehtereum</strong> blockchain.
              				While there are unique languages and frameworks you must know to
              				begin coding blockchain, I have heard from the dev community that
              				learning <strong>JS</strong> is a good starting point.I have spent
              				a lot of time in the past year learning how to use
              				<strong>Java</strong>, and this has honestly made learning JS a
              				breeze :)</p>
